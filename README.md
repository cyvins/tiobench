Installation:

	compile by typing 'make'
	after compilation './tiotest -h' should give you list of options
	for backend io tester. 

	'./tiobench.pl --help' will give you more nicer output
	and more friendly user interface

	tiobench.pl is frontend to tiotest to run predefined or 
	configurable test suites

Credits:
	
	James Manning <jmm at users.sf.net> wrote tiobench.pl
	and also provided several fixes and improvements to 
	other parts of the tiobench project as a whole. He also has
	relentlessly fixed typos and Mika's misspellings 
	everywhere.

	Jakob Ã˜stergaard <jakob at ostenfeld.dk> proposed fsync
	fix, and option for sequential writing to prevent
	file fragmentation.

	Sami Korhonen <sjkorhon at cc.hut.fi> noticed
	thread_attr not initialized bug.

	Numerous other contributions from fearless benchmarkers.


Build instructions:

	The below steps to compile to cross compile the source for 32bit and 64 bit arm processors
	Setup tool chain for arm and arch64-arm
	For example using the linaro toolchain:

	64 bit:
	
		http://releases.linaro.org/14.11/components/toolchain/binaries/aarch64-linux-gnu
	
	32 bit:
	
		http://releases.linaro.org/14.11/components/toolchain/binaries/arm-linux-gnueabi

	Download the tarball and extract the toolchain
	Then add the tool chain to your $PATH.
  
	To compile :

	64 bit:

	$ cd tiobench
	$ make CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc LINK=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc LDFLAGS=-static tiotest
  
	32 bit:

	$ cd tiobench
	$ make CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc LINK=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc LDFLAGS=-static tiotest

	This should generate the tiotest binary in the same folder as your source.
